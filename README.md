#### Notes/Discoveries/Comments
If a parent element contains only floated elements, the height will collapse to nothing. This will cause issues in formatting. One way to fix this is to set overflow to hidden  or auto which will allow parent element to expand to contain the floats (https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

#### Abstract
Community-based storytelling project in which a user can register for an account, then contribute to, create, and view stories.

They can also view the full text of stories they have already contributed to.
